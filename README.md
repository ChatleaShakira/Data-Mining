# Data-Mining and Business Intelligence
## Exploration of Health Data with The Mining Process
\
Data Mining and Business Intelligence is one of the elective courses in the Statistics program at the University of Indonesia that I took in my fourth semester. This course is designed to enable students to identify information and insights that are hidden in data using various statistical and machine learning methods and provide recommendations that can be done by the users.\
\
**Process**:
1. Preprocessing\
   a. Checking the data type\
   b. Handling noise and outliers\
   c. Handling missing values\
   d. Removing data duplication\
   e. Checking the correlation
2. Data Analysis\
   a. SVM Method\
   b. Decision Tree Method\
   c. K-NN Method\
   d. Demographic Exploration\
   e. Looking at the relationship between variables
3. Visualization
4. Finding insights from the data
